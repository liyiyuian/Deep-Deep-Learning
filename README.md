# Introduction
I will record the papers I read here, and write a summary for each one of them [here](https://hackmd.io/@DBUyNCQ1Q1S3ECugt2X6HQ/HyIt069pU).

The buildup of this list will focus on five main directions:

1. The classic models and follow-up studies,
2. The reinforcement learning and active learning,
2. The application on the biomedical research,
3. The application on the stock market,
4. The state-of-the-art models that even your grandma knows.
